# **App Name**: Shadow Wallet

## Core Features:

- Shadow Balance Visualization: Display balances as blurred shapes and shifting shadows that hint at value without revealing exact amounts. Actual amounts are revealed temporarily upon authentication.
- Lock/Unlock Reveal Animation: Implement a smooth, cinematic transition when the user authenticates, dispersing the shadows to reveal the true balance.
- Stealth Mode Home Screen: Design a home screen that provides essential wallet information without explicitly displaying sensitive data, offering enhanced privacy. A generative AI tool suggests adjustments for enhanced stealth.
- Transaction History: A simplified transaction history log with masked details that can be revealed on interaction.
- Secure Authentication: Implement biometric and/or password-based authentication for secure access to the wallet.
- Basic Send/Receive Functionality: Enable users to send and receive cryptocurrencies securely.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, muted blue-gray (#4A5568) to evoke mystery and elegance.
- Background color: Almost black (#1A202C) for a digital eclipse effect, very low saturation to maintain darkness.
- Accent color: Diffused neon purple (#A382F7) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif font. Use 'Inter' for both headlines and body text.
- Design a logo featuring a crescent made of overlapping shadows, and use minimalist, shadowed icons throughout the interface to enhance the feeling of weight and depth.
- Utilize soft gradients and subtle glows to create a sense of depth and atmosphere.
- Motion should feel like bending light, with whisper-thin, reactive buttons that provide a sense of being alive and breathing in the dark.
